###Wallace

Wallace is a platform for conducting research on experimental cultural evolution. Its namesake is Alfred Russel Wallace, a British naturalist and the oft-ignored codiscoverer of evolution by natural selection. You can use Wallace to create new experiments or to reproduce existing experiments.
