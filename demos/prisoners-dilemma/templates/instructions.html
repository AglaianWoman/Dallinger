            <p>In this experiment, you will be randomly matched with another
            person on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Neither of you will ever know the
            identity of the other. Both of you will receive a fixed amount of
            $0.25 for participating in the experiment. In addition, you will be
            able to earn more money based on the decision you make in the
            experiment.</p>

            <p>Each of you will choose whether to COOPERATE or DEFECT
            in your interaction with the other:</p>

            <p>If you both choose to COOPERATE, you will each earn a $0.50 bonus.</p>

            <p>If you choose to DEFECT while the other person chooses to COOPERATE,
            you will earn a $0.75 bonus and the other person will earn no bonus.</p>

            <p>If you choose to COOPERATE while the other person chooses
            to DEFECT, you will earn no bonus and the other person will earn $0.75.</p>

            <p>If you both choose to DEFECT, you will each earn a $0.25 cent bonus.</p>
