            <p>In the game, there are two bars &mdash; blue and red. Your goal is to learn the relationship between the sizes of these two bars.</p>

            <p> In the first half of the game, you will receive training. On each round, the blue bar will appear, and you will guess how big the red bar should be. Move the mouse up and down to adjust the size of the red bar, and then click to enter your response. A grey bar will appear next to it, showing you the correct answer. You will then have the opportunity to correct your answer, readjusting the red bar so that it perfectly matches the correct value. Press the space bar to move on to the next round.</p>

            <p>In the second half of the game, you will be test. This round is exactly like the training, except you will not get to see the correct answer. On each round, the blue bar will appear, and you should adjust the size of the red bar accordingly. Click to enter your response, and then press the space bar to move on to the next round.</p>

            <p>Please read the <a href="/consent.pdf" target="_blank">consent form.</a></p>
